# TODO

- Kinect integration
- GUI pattern selector (pattern queue list, voice activated?)
- set global beat sensitivity setting so we don't have to adjust it per skecth
- fix relative path issue so we don't have to hardcode paths
- figure out how to read frames from the OpenGL canvas (P2D,P3D)
- set scale=1 when running in prod (reduces cpu usage, avoids resizing frames)
- make sure all patterns are optimized to run at native tunnel size (scale = 1)
